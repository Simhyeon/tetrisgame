### This is a learning project for amethyst game engine.

Executable binary is in release section. While compilation would also work unless vulkan backend is not accessible. 

If you wnat to compile by yourself then.
```
git clone https://github.com/Simhyeon/tetrisgame
cd tetrisgame
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

### Caution

This game is really buggy. I tried to find some solutions. 

But I made this game as a learning project and hardly care about refactor ability of the codes.

If I need to fix the bugs the I have to redesign everything from start or I need to put much more temporary "fix" codes, and this game has many such codes already.

So I just finished the project. While most of the "Operation" will just work, but would cuase error and will show game over screen in some time. 

At worst it will crash without any game over screen.

### About my Learning

I'm planning to write about what I've learnt about game development, data oriented programming, ECS pattern, amethyst enine on my blog. 

Since I'm not a professional programmer so my experience wouldn't be helpful to most of the people but if whomever interested is welcomed.
