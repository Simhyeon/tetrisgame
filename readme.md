### This is a learning project for amethyst game engine.

Executable binary is in release section. While compilation would also work unless vulkan backend is not accessible. 

### Caution

This game is really buggy. I tried to find some solutions. But I didn't want to spend more time in amethyst engine.

So I just finished the project. While 80% of the "Operation" will just work, but would cuase error and will show game over screen at the end, sadly. 

At worst it will crash without any game over screen.

### About my Learning

I'm planning to write about what I've learnt about game development, data oriented programming, ECS pattern, amethyst enine on my blog. 

Since I'm not a professional programmer so my experience wouldn't be helpful to most of the people but if whomever interested is welcomed.
